    "### Data Leakage\n",
    "- A naive approach to preparing data applies the transform on the entire dataset before evaluating the performance of the model. This results in a problem referred to as **data leakage**,\n",
    "- where knowledge of the hold-out test set leaks into the dataset used to train the model. This can result in an incorrect estimate of model performance when making predictions on new data.\n",
    "- When data from the future is leaked to the past. Any time that a model is given information that it shouldn’t have access to when it is making predictions in real time in production, there is leakage.  \n",
    "- We get data leakage by applying data preparation techniques to the entire dataset. This is not a direct type of data leakage, where we would train the model on the test dataset. Instead, it is an indirect type of data leakage, where some knowledge about the test dataset, captured in summary statistics is available to the model during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1: Using Future Data (Time Series Leakage)\n",
    "- Suppose you are predicting tomorrow’s stock price using past data\n",
    "- Your dataset accidentally includes a feature like:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Date  | Closing Price | 7-Day Moving Avg (calculated using future days!) |\n",
    "| ----- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |\n",
    "| Jan 1 | 100           | 105                                              |\n",
    "| Jan 2 | 98            | 103                                              |\n",
    "| ...   |               |                                                  |\n",
    "\n",
    "- If that moving average uses future prices, then your model is seeing information from after the prediction moment.\n",
    "- 👉 In reality, when predicting Jan 1, you cannot know Jan 7 values.\n",
    "📌 Result:\n",
    "    - Training accuracy: 98%\n",
    "    - Real-world accuracy: 50% or random\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 2: Target Leakage\n",
    "- Predicting whether a customer will default on a loan.\n",
    "- Suppose our dataset includes a column, `Paid_late_last_month`.    and the label you are predicting is `loan_default`\n",
    "- If this feature is strongly correlated with the output because it happens after the loan approval, then the model is learning something it wouldn’t know at decision time.\n",
    "- Model learns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 👉 “If paid_late_last_month = Yes → predict default.”\n",
    "- But in real deployment this feature won’t exist at the time of loan approval.\n",
    "- 📌 Result: Unrealistically high validation score.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 3: Data Split Leakage\n",
    "- Suppose, You scale or normalize the full dataset before splitting into train and test:\n",
    "- \n",
    "``` scaler = StandardScaler()\n",
    "    df_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(df)   # WRONG\n",
    "    train, test = train_test_split(df_scaled)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- fit_transform used all data statistics, including test set.\n",
    "- So the model indirectly sees test distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to Prevent Leakage\n",
    "- ✔ Split data before preprocessing, scaling, and feature selection\n",
    "- ✔ For time-series: split chronologically (train → past, test → future)\n",
    "- ✔ Avoid using future or outcome-derived features\n",
    "- ✔ Validate feature logic: “Would I know this before prediction?”\n",
    "- ✔ Use pipelines (sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline) to prevent accidental leakage\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Quick Detection Rule\n",
    "- Ask this question:\n",
    "    - Would this information be available at the exact moment the prediction is made?   \n",
    "    - If the answer is No → leakage."
