    "## The core intuition\n",
    "- When a model learns, it tries to fit the training data as best as possible — by adjusting weights (β’s).But if it fits too well, it may start memorizing the data instead of learning general patterns — this is called overfitting.\n",
    "- Regularization is a penalty that discourages the model from:\n",
    "  - Making weights too large\n",
    "  - Becoming too complex\n",
    "  - Overreacting to small noise in the data\n",
    "### Think of regularization as \"discipline for the weights\"\n",
    "- Without regularization:\n",
    "  - The model says: “I’ll do anything to make my predictions perfect.”\n",
    "  - It might assign huge coefficients to certain features.\n",
    "- With regularization:\n",
    "  - We say: “Sure, fit the data — but don’t go crazy with those weights.”\n",
    "  - This keeps the model simpler and more generalizable.\n",
    "### The mathematical idea\n",
    "- We modify the loss function (e.g., logistic loss) by adding a penalty term that depends on the weights.\n",
    "  - We calculate our original loss for all samples. based on this loss ( by taking its partial derivative with respect to weight, we calculate the gradiant descent for that weight)\n",
    "  - With Regularization, lets add a small term to the total loss. \n",
    "    - `New Loss=Original Loss+λ×Penalty(Weights)`\n",
    "      - 𝜆 (lambda) = regularization strength (a tuning hyperparameter)\n",
    "      - Higher 𝜆 → more penalty → simpler model\n",
    "      - Lower 𝜆 → less penalty → model can fit more freely  \n",
    "### Two common types of regularization\n",
    "#### L2 Regularization (Ridge)\n",
    "- Penalty = sum of squares of the weights:\n",
    "- Penalty= ∑​βj^2\n",
    "- So the loss becomes: loss = `−log-likelihood + λ ∑​βj^2`\n",
    "- **Effect:**\n",
    "  - Penalizes large weights smoothly.\n",
    "  - Tends to shrink weights but not set them exactly to zero.\n",
    "  - Keeps all features, just with smaller influence.\n",
    "  - **Intuition**: “Don’t let any single feature dominate — share responsibility.”\n",
    "#### L1 Regularization (Lasso)\n",
    "- Penalty = sum of absolute values of weights:\n",
    "- Penalty=∑​∣βj​∣\n",
    "- So the loss becomes `Loss=−log-likelihood+ λ ∑​∣βj​∣`\n",
    "- **Effect:**\n",
    "  - Encourages sparsity (many weights become exactly 0).\n",
    "  - This means some features get completely dropped → feature selection effect.\n",
    "  - **Intuition**: “Keep only the most useful features, ignore the rest.”\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Elastic Net (Hybrid)\n",
    "- Sometimes, we combine both:\n",
    "  - `Loss= −log-likelihood+ λ1​∑∣βj​∣ + λ2​∑βj^2​`\n",
    "  - It balances feature selection (L1) and weight shrinkage (L2).\n",
    "\n",

    "### Mathematcally L2 (Ridge) regularization\n",
    "- Normally, in regression or logistic regression, we minimize the loss:\n",
    "  - `J(w)=Loss(all Samples) = ∑​(yi​−y^​i​)^2`\n",
    "- WIth L2 regularization we minimize the Loss + (L2 penalty)\n",
    "  -  `Jreg​(w) = ∑​(yi​−y^​i​)^2 + λ ∑​wj^2​`\n",
    "- Now we use Optimizer to find the gradiant for each weight.\n",
    "- Let’s compute the derivative of the penalty part:\n",
    "  - `∂/∂wj ​​(λwj^2​)= 2λwj​`\n",
    "- Lets calculate the gradiant of total loss + penalty.\n",
    "  - `wj​ ← wj ​−η (∂/∂wj(​Loss)​ + 2λwj​)  `   -> η is learning rate, ∂/∂wj(​Loss) -> gradiant of loss,  2λwj -> is the derivative of penalty/regularization part.  thats how we update wj. \n",
    "\n",
    "- That extra **2λwj** term is crucial — it says:\n",
    "  - **“The bigger wj is, the more I’ll push it toward zero.”**\n",
    "- So:\n",
    "  - A big weight (say wj = 10) gets a large correction (pushes it down a lot as 2.λ.wj -> will be some value with respect to wj ), think λ = 0.1 So 2.λ.wj = 2\n",
    "  - A small weight (say wj = 0.1) gets a tiny correction. -> 2.λ.wj = 0.02 .\n",
    "  - So the first once is penalized by 2, and the second one is penalized by 0.2\n",
    "\n",
    "- **This means large weights are penalized more strongly, automatically.**: That’s why the penalty term is not a “constant it depends on the size of each wj\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why L2 doesn’t push weights exactly to zero\n",
    "- The shrinkage term  2λwj is proportional to w_j itself.\n",
    "- That means:\n",
    "  - The bigger wj is, the bigger the shrinkage.\n",
    "  - As wj gets smaller, the shrinkage becomes weaker.\n",
    "  - When wj gets very close to zero, 2λwj ≈ 0 — the regularization force becomes negligible.\n",
    "  - So the optimizer slows down as it approaches zero and usually stops before hitting exactly 0. → It shrinks continuously, but never sets to 0 exactly.\n",
    "\n",

    "- **Let’s see an example.**\n",

    "- For L2, the “pull strength” = 2λwj, which weakens as wj→0. So once a weight is small, the pull becomes almost nothing.\n",
    "- For L1, the “pull strength” = constant ±λ — even when wj is tiny!,  So the optimizer keeps pushing it toward 0 until it crosses exactly zero — where it can stop abruptly.\n",
