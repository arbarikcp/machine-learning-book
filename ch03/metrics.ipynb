    "- **Accuracy**: Overall correctness\n",
    "- **Precision**: Quality of positive predictions\n",
    "- **Recall (Sensitivity)**: Ability to find all positives\n",
    "- **Specificity**: Ability to find all negatives\n",
    "- **F1 Score**: Balance between precision and recall\n",
    "- **F-beta Score**: Weighted balance favoring precision or recall\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Confusion Matrix**\n",
    "    - **True Positives** (TP): Correctly predicted positive cases -> positive means, what we are predicting is positive. if in our model we are finding if a person has a disease or not, then TP means the person has the disease and our model predicted it correctly \n",
    "    - **True Negatives** (TN): Correctly predicted negative cases\n",
    "    - **False Positives** (FP): Incorrectly predicted positive cases ->  if in our model we are finding if a person has a disease or not, then FP means the person does not have the disease but our model predicted it as positive \n",
    "    - **False Negatives** (FN): Incorrectly predicted negative cases -> if in our model we are finding if a person has a disease or not, then FN means the person has the disease but our model predicted it as negative\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Note**: the first part True/False is our prediction is right/wrong with respect to the actual value and the second part Pos/Neg is what we predicted.\n",

    "        - True Negatives: Actual value is negative and predicted value is negative\n",

    "\n",
    "#### ✅ 1. Use cases where RECALL is very important (Precision not critical)\n",
    "- These situations care about finding ALL positives, even if we raise some false alarms.\n",
    "- **Recall** or **Sensitivity** means From all positive how many we predicted correctly.  So in situation where we need to predict all positives correctly, So we need to push recall to 100%. \n",
    "-  Recall = `TP / (TP + FN)` -> So have to make FN as close to 0. If we try to make FN to 0 then FP will increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **📌 1.1 Cancer screening (initial stage)**\n",
    "        - Goal: Catch every possible cancer case.\n",
    "        - Better to flag 100 people and later verify, than miss 1 real patient.\n",
    "        - Missing a real cancer case = critical failure (FN is terrible).\n",
    "        - Extra false alarms (FP) → just more tests → acceptable.\n",
    "        👉 High Recall, low Precision is okay.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **📌 1.2 Fraud Detection (first-level alert)**\n",
    "        -  Banks run models to identify any suspicious transaction.\n",
    "        -  Missing a fraud → loses money\n",
    "        -  But false alarms → manual review → acceptable \n",
    "        - 👉 Catch everything (high recall), even if many alerts are wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **📌 1.3 Search-and-rescue drone detection**\n",
    "        - Drones detect humans in disaster zones.\n",
    "        - Missing a survivor → life-threatening\n",
    "        - False positives → just check more locations \n",
    "        - 👉 Maximize recall even if precision drops.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    - **📌 1.4 Spam detection (very early stage)**\n",
    "        - If an email might be spam, it can be flagged for review.\n",
    "        - Missing real spam → user sees harmful mail\n",

    "- Here, you care about being right when predicting positive, and you can afford missing some positives.\n",
    "- False positive are not afforable, TP / (TP + FP) , So in this case we try to make FP close to 0. If we try to do FP close to 0, then FN will increase.\n",

    "        - Netflix suggests movies.\n",
    "        - Showing a bad recommendation → poor experience (FP)\n",

    "        - 👉 Better to show fewer but accurate suggestions → precision.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    - **📌 2.3 Advertising (Click-through Prediction)**     \n",
    "        - You show an ad only when user is very likely to click.\n",
    "        - Showing irrelevant ads → money wasted\n",
    "        - Not showing an ad to a potential user → minor loss\n",

    "\n",
    "    - **📌 2.4 Job candidate shortlisting**\n",
    "        - You only want strong candidates.\n",

    "\n",

    "        - Being wrong is very costly\n",
    "        - Missing positives is tolerable\n",
    "        - Examples: policing, recommendations, ads, hiring     \n",
    "\n",
    "#### ✅ 3. Use cases where BOTH Precision and Recall are very important\n",
    "- **📌 3.1 Medical Diagnosis (final confirmation stage)**\n",
    "    - After initial screening, a physician reviews the final ML output.\n",
    "    - Missing disease → dangerous\n",
    "    - False disease prediction → unnecessary treatment / trauma\n",
    "    - 👉 Need both high recall and high precision.   \n",
    "\n",
    "- **📌 3.2 Autonomous vehicles (pedestrian detection)**\n",
    "    - Car must: Detect ALL pedestrians (recall)\n",
    "    - Not detect trash cans as pedestrians (precision)\n",
    "    - Both errors are dangerous.   \n",
    "\n",
    "- **📌 3.3 Credit card fraud blocking (automatic block)**\n",
    "    - If system automatically blocks the card:\n",
    "    - Blocked wrongly → bad customer experience\n",
    "    - Missed fraud → money lost\n",
    "    - Both errors expensive → F1-score matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **📌 3.4 Content moderation: deleting harmful content**\n",
    "    - Platform must: Capture all harmful content (recall)\n",
    "    - Not accidentally delete normal posts (precision)\n",
    "    - Both matter for user experience + safety.    "
